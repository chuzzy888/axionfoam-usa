          "Your new mattress is an investment in better sleep, which is vital in having the energy you need to get through your busy days. You should take care of that investment, and a mattress protector is the best and easiest way to do that.

Regular vacuuming of the mattress using a handheld attachment during your regular cleaning cycles at home is an easy way to clean your mattress. Take caution when considering how to wash the mattress in the event of accidental spills or stains. Saturating the foams and fibers with liquid cleaners and water can damage the foam.
